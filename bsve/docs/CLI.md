# BSVE Command-Line Interface

## Overview

BSVE (Behavioral State Validation Engine) is the calibration and validation
subsystem for the Market Sentiment ML project.  It derives empirical maturity
boundaries for consensus-state ontologies from historical H1 sentiment data,
produces versioned calibration artifacts, and provides inspection and
validation utilities for pre-deployment sign-off.

---

## Calibration

Run the JPY maturity boundary calibration against a master research dataset.

```bash
python -m bsve.calibration.jpy_maturity_calibration \
    --dataset-path data/output/1.5.0/master_research_dataset_core.csv \
    --dataset-version 1.5.0 \
    --output-dir bsve.test/
```

**Additional options**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--pairs` | `USDJPY EURJPY GBPJPY` | Space-separated JPY pairs to include |
| `--start` | `2019-01-01` | Calibration window start (ISO date) |
| `--end` | `2026-12-31` | Calibration window end (ISO date) |
| `--state-spec` | `bsve/state_specs/reactive_jpy_v1.yaml` | State-spec YAML |
| `--calibration-id` | auto-generated | Override artifact identifier |
| `--plot` | off | Emit hazard curve PNG for sign-off review |

**Outputs**

- A versioned JSON calibration artifact written to `--output-dir`.
- Console summary of thresholds and diagnostics.
- Optional hazard curve PNG (`jpy_hazard_curve.png`) when `--plot` is set.

---

## Artifact Inspection

Inspect a calibration artifact and display its thresholds and diagnostics.

```bash
python -m bsve.calibration.inspect <artifact.json>
```

**Example**

```bash
python -m bsve.calibration.inspect bsve/calibration_artifacts/reactive_jpy_calibration_v1.json
```

**Displayed diagnostics**

- Ontology ID and version
- Calibration mode and outcome
- Thresholds: extreme threshold, young boundary, mature boundary
- Episode count, median duration, censoring rate
- Reversal rates (young and mature maturity zones)
- Hazard crossover bar
- Survival counts (when present):

  ```
  Survival Counts
  ---------------
  >= 8 bars  : XXX
  >=16 bars  : XXX
  >=24 bars  : XXX
  >=32 bars  : XXX
  >=48 bars  : XXX
  ```

- Threshold provenance metadata

Older artifacts that do not contain survival counts are handled gracefully;
the section is omitted from the output.

---

## Calibration Validation

Validate all committed calibration artifacts against the BSVE schema and
quality gates.

```bash
python -m bsve.calibration.validate_calibrations
```

**Purpose**

Ensures every artifact in `bsve/calibration_artifacts/` is schema-valid,
has a consistent hash, and meets minimum quality criteria before state
assignment begins.  Run this after each new calibration run.

---

## Artifact Locations

Committed, immutable calibration artifacts are stored under:

```
bsve/calibration_artifacts/
```

Ad-hoc or test calibration runs write artifacts to the directory specified
via `--output-dir` (e.g. `bsve.test/`).  Test-run artifacts must not be
committed to `bsve/calibration_artifacts/` unless they have passed manual
review and validation.

---

## Current Workflow

The pre-deployment sign-off sequence is:

```
1. Calibration
       python -m bsve.calibration.jpy_maturity_calibration ...
   ↓
2. Inspect Artifact
       python -m bsve.calibration.inspect <artifact.json>
   ↓
3. Validate Calibration
       python -m bsve.calibration.validate_calibrations
   ↓
4. Manual Review
       Confirm reversal_rate_young >> reversal_rate_mature.
       Review survival counts for threshold plausibility.
   ↓
5. State Assignment (future)
```

---

## Future Commands

The following commands are planned and will be documented here as they are
implemented.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `python -m bsve.state.assign` | Assign behavioral states to sentiment timelines using committed thresholds |
| `python -m bsve.timeline.generate` | Generate behavioral state timelines from state assignments |
| `python -m bsve.ontology.validate` | Validate ontology YAML definitions against the BSVE schema |
